            The critic Kenneth Burke once called literature “equipment for living.”<br>
            He viewed poems, proverbs, plays, and novels as <strong> “a ritualistic way of arming us to confront
            perplexities and risks.”</strong> But is this insight limited to literature? <br>
            The purpose of this class is to examine media technologies in general as equipment for living, and to
            apply this theory to digital image-making and world-building.
