Can a particular combination of perceived senses evoke a sense of nostalgia? Are there conventions for how nostalgia should look, sound, or feel?

Mediums, between Nostalgia and Memories explores how we perceive and experience nostalgia triggered by different mediums. By inviting the player to roam a void-like planet with random encounters with various objects, the game experience encourages them to reflect on moments when they were unexpectedly transported into their core memories, only to return to reality seconds later.

I was riffing on the idea of a classic shape-sorter baby toy, and wanted to design complex blocks that fit multiple holes; that morphed into a short, interactive story. Introducing: Shadows.

Our memories endure time, becoming gradually flawed with new interpretations and memories. They are resilient in recalling pasts, yet also fragile beings filled with subtle inconsistencies. They contain and build new gaps in thought. They are imperfect, and broken. The same is true for cardboard boxes. Alike memories, they are maleable, permeable and susceptable to disintigration. A wandering (eventual time) based experience, the work reflects on an urgent process of containing memories.",
